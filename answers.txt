• What is a gitignore file and what should it include for a Java project?
-> A .gitignore file is required to tell git what files to ignore or not to include. For a Java project, there are multiple types
of files which git should ignore like the package files (.jar, .war, .zip, .rar etc.), log files (.log) or the compiled class files (.class).

• What does fast-forward in git mean?
-> When a branch catches up with the changes in another branch, then that process is called fast-forward. It can be considered different from
merging as git can just integrate the newer changes within the old branch from the branch having those newer changes.

• Why should you have different branches?
-> Different branches are required when we do not want to mess up the work that we already have in the current branch like experiment with
new features, or fix bugs bugs with the code in the current branch.

• In a project how many remote Git repositories do you usually have?
-> In a project, we usually have only one remote Git repository that we work with. All the collaborators are added to that same remote repository. Each
collaborator has their own local repository which they can link to the remote one.
